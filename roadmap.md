# Simplified Roguelike Bounce Game Development Roadmap

## Core Game Concept
A physics-based roguelike where players bounce within a single large room, fighting waves of enemies through collision mechanics. The game features Earth, Solar, and Black Hole themed enemies, with increasing difficulty after completing each set.

## Phase 1: Foundation Systems

### Game Engine Architecture
- Implement game loop using requestAnimationFrame
- Design entity-component system for object management
- Create wave-based state management system
- Implement delta time movement calculations
- Build event system for game communication

### Physics Engine Design
- Create velocity-based movement system
- Implement mass-based collision resolution
- Design friction and boundary systems
- Include restitution coefficients for bouncing
- Optimize collision detection with spatial partitioning

### Core Player Mechanics
- Design drag-and-release control system
- Implement momentum-based movement
- Add screen shake effects
- Include invulnerability frames
- Design health system with visual feedback

## Phase 2: Wave System

### Enemy Spawning
- Design wave progression system
- Implement difficulty scaling
- Create enemy spawn patterns
- Balance enemy count per wave
- Design boss wave triggers

### Enemy Types
Each type features unique behaviors:

#### Earth Enemies
- High health, slow movement
- Ground-based attacks
- Defensive behaviors

#### Solar Enemies
- Medium health, balanced speed
- Projectile-focused attacks
- Aggressive pursuit

#### Black Hole Enemies
- Low health, high speed
- Gravitational mechanics
- Erratic movement

### Boss Mechanics
- Unique boss per element type
- Special attack patterns
- Health scaling with difficulty
- Visual indicators for boss phases

## Phase 3: Upgrade System

### Progress Rewards
- Wave completion bonuses
- Boss defeat upgrades
- Difficulty-based rewards

### Upgrade Categories
- Stat Modifications:
  - Health changes (±20%)
  - Speed adjustments (±30%)
  - Damage multipliers (±40%)

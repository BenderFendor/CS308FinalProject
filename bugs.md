The enemy freeze just doesn't work

All enemies are one shot for some reason.
    Probably has to do with hitting them mutiples times a second add debugging statements to see that.

Speed is handled really oddly like the game speed up randomly I think it because when you like tab out the game clock still counts but the game it self doesn't move making it just speed the game up?
